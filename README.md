# ACM-Self_Driving_car

To create an ML Model using Deep Q Learning that would self-drive a car and simulate the same.
In this project, we apply a deep learning model developed by Minh, to learn optimal control patterns from visual input using reinforcement learning. 
This method can be used for many applications, but we wanted to apply it to a car and make it self-drive. 
Since we are making a simulation of the same, we intend to take raw pixel values from the screen and use a Convolutional Neural Network which was trained using DQN learning to predict the next action to be taken by the car. This type of model can be used with any action-reward problems such as video games, chess etc.
